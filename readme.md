# Server monitoring project

This project will register some sites to monitor if they still available.
In case of any problem, it will alert what site has some availability problems.

## Motivation

- This project is a implementation of a server side api using only node api with no dependencies. This proposal is following the pirple course https://pirple.thinkific.com/courses/the-nodejs-master-class

- This is some experiments on how far we can implement a service without using any dependencies from npm.


# How to start

```shell
node index.js
```
